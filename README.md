# Customer Segmentation Analysis for Data-driven Marketing Strategies
# Excel to Power BI


## Description: 
This is a Customer Segmentation Analysis Project that involves importing customer data from Excel, followed by data cleaning using Power Query and transformation using Power BI. I also created interactive visualizations to identify distinct customer segments using Power BI. The main objective is to offer critical insights for informed business decision-making and the development of data-driven marketing strategies for my client.

![OrderPriority](assets/image/Screenshot 2025-12-03 114540.png)

Delivery speed aligns strongly with order priority. Critical orders are fulfilled in under 2 days on average, while low-priority orders take over 6 days.

Medium-priority orders generate most of the total profit, contributing more than all other priority levels combined. High-priority and Critical orders also contribute positively, while Low-priority orders generate minimal profit.

### QUESTION 5: Which shipping modes (Same Day, First Class, Second Class, Standard Class) are most commonly used?

![ShippingModeAnalysis](assets/image/Screenshot 2025-12-03 115304.png)

Standard shipping accounts for 60% of all orders, making it the most widely used ship mode. Every Category relies heavily on standard shipping: Office Supplies, Technology, and Furniture all show their highest shipment volumes under Standard Class. 

Gross profit is consistent across shipping methods, Standard 11.6%, Second 11.58%, First 11.4%, Same Day 11.2%, showing that faster shipping has minimal impact on profitability. Standard shipping not only leads in volume but also drives most of the net profit at £263K.

### QUESTION 6: What are the most profitable customer segments, countries, and cities?

![ProfitbySegment](assets/image/Screenshot 2025-12-03 212656.png)

Technology contributes the most to profit across all segments.

### QUESTION 7: How do discounts offered impact overall sales and profitability?

![DiscountsnProfitability](assets/image/Screenshot 2025-12-03 214344.png)

For Category: Higher average discounts are linked with lower total profit. This is evident as Furniture has the highest discount (0.17) and the lowest profit (£0.28M), while Technology has the lowest discount (0.13) and the highest profit (£0.66M).

For Segment: Higher average discounts correlate with higher profit. This is shown by Consumer Segment having the highest discount (0.142) and highest profit (£0.75M), while Home Office has the lowest profit (£0.28M) and lowest discount.

### QUESTION 8: What are the monthly or quarterly sales trends over the years?
